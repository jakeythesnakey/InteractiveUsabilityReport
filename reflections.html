			<h1>Battle of the Briefcase</h1>
			<h2>Laptop vs Tablet</h2>

			<h2>Jake Kampkes Personal Reflection</h2><br>

			<h3>Results of study</h3><br><br>


			This study taught us that if you want a portable word processing machine, then a laptop is a faster choice than a tablet with a virtual keyboard.<br>



			<br><h3>Why I chose this topic</h3><br><br>


			I chose this topic as this year I have had to make a choice about personal devices involving this very issue. I only own a tablet and not a laptop and had to choose whether to purchase a laptop. This is an issue faced by both students and professionals with limited space in their bags for electronic devices. As these are often the primary device that users interact with, a large part of the user's day can be improved or worsened by this interaction.<br>

			There are many factors to consider: OS usability, weight, ergonomics, aesthetics, ease of learning. We decided, however, to focus on typing speed as it is one of the key uses of these electronic devices, and easily quantifiable. This experiment in typing speed on virtual vs physical keyboards answers the word-processing component of the laptop-tablet dilemma.<br>

			<br><h3>My responsibilities</h3><br><br>


			As the only member of this group I was responsible for everything. Website building, experiment design, soliciting participants, experiment execution, results analysis, displaying of results, and drawing conclusions were all my responsibility. <br>

			<br>Experiment design was simple but interesting. I found two sentances that contain every letter of the alphabet, one commonly known and simple, one more obscure and complicated. This was to make sure the participants use the full range of the keyboard. I decided that extra reading time should be given beforehand as we did not want to test reading speed or comprehension. The participants were timed for how long to complete the script and not on the number of words typed in a given time. This was to ensure there were no &apos;easy&apos; or &apos;difficult&apos; parts of the scriot that faster writers might get to that slower writers might not, skewing the results. Errors were collected to check that accuracy was not sacrificed for speed as would be indicated by an increase in errors as well as an increase in speed, confounding the results.<br>

			<br>The website was a simple exercise. Drawing on what I learned in web development, a simple html website was easy to construct quickly. Given more time I could make a more attractive one, but there was simply not enough time with all my other projects. It displays the project. It is interactive.  That is enough.<br>

			<br>Soliciting Participants was more difficult than expected. We got 23 out of the expected 30 but that was enough to reject the null hypothesis at p=0.05. Everybody is busy at the end of term.<br>

			<br>The experiments themselves went smoothly. In the computer labs there is ample space, with plenty of equipment including chairs and desks. It is a quiet environment. <br>

			<br>Results analysis was relatively straightforward. A two-sample unpaired t-test was sufficient for errors and for typing speeds. Having not done statistics in years I needed to touch up my skills. Khan academy was a fantastic resource for that. To display the results a histogram served best as it allows readers to view the normal curves and visually compare the means. The results drew a very clear picture, and it was clear that the laptop provided a far faster typing experience. <br>

			<br><h3>What I Learned</h3><br><br>
			<br>This process taught me a lot about human-computer interaction. Part of this was understanding that HCI is all about trading off different priorities for the best personal result. In the case of this experiment it was trading off typing speed for weight and size convenience. We showed a definite decrease in typing speed which is a sacrifice that may or may not be worth it depending on a person&apos;s circumstances. Being aware of these trade-offs make us better informed when making decisions about our interfaces when developing or choosing products.<br>
