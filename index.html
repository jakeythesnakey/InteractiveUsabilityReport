			<h1>Battle of the Briefcase</h1>
			<h2>Laptop vs Tablet</h2>

			<h2>Introduction</h2><br>

			Workers type a lot. They spend hours typing reports, articles, and emails (BPS, 2012). They spend much of this time at a desk, at a keyboard, typing. However, not all knowledge workers work in an office, In the US, 52 percent of firms allow remote work (Owllabs, 2018). Some roles such as those that require travel mean that employees by definition must work outside the office. For those on the move, the less weight, the better. For many this means carrying not a laptop but a tablet. They are extremely portable, but seemingly less ergonomic than a traditional keyboard for typing (Ozok et. al, 2008).<br><br>

			Traditional keyboards are made up of round 80-110 keys (Tyson, Wilson & Pollette, 2019). The main part of the keyboard are the letters of the alphabet arranged in the QWERTY layout surrounded by number, punctuation and function keys (Fendalman, 2019). These keys are usually plastic keycaps suspended over electrical switches by a membrane or spring. When the key is pressed, it lowers onto the switch below, completing the circuit, and letting the computer know that the key has been pressed.<br><br>

			Touchscreens, on the other hand, work differently. Most smart devices us a capacitive touchscreen (Price, 2019). These touch screens have tiny wires embedded in the screen, and when your finger comes in contact, it completes the circuit between the wires, telling the device where it is being touched. This location is compared to the locations of the keys projected on the keyboard, and and if they match, it registers a key press.<br><br>

			What we want to know is: Is there a significant difference in the typing speeds of those on a touchscreen, compared with using a traditional keyboard? This would allow users to make a more informed decision about whether to purchase a laptop or a tablet for working out of the office.<br><br>
