			<h1>Battle of the Briefcase</h1>
			<h2>Laptop vs Tablet</h2>

			<h2>Method</h2><br>

			Research Question<br>
			Does a  physical keyboard provide a significant improvement in typing speed over a virtual keyboard?<br><br>
			Participants<br>
			Fifteen volunteering undergraduate students will be chosen by convenience sampling at AUT to test the virtual keyboard,
			 and fifteen volunteering undergraduate students will be chosen by the same method to test the physical keyboard.
			All are familiar with the US QWERTY keyboard layout.<br><br>

			<h2>Equipment</h2><br>

			Desk<br><br>

			A standard AUT computer lab desk with flat surface and suitable height for typing.<br><br>

			Chair<br><br>

			A standard AUT swivel chair. Participant may adjust the height for their comfort.<br><br>

			Seating Position<br><br>

			Participants will be seated in the position most comfortable for them. With the laptop or tablet placed approximately 20 cm in front of them. Participants may adjust this seating position as they desire.<br><br>

			Tablet<br><br>

			A Samsung Tab S2 tablet<br>
			Operating System: Android 7.0 "Nougat with Samsung Experience"<br>
			Display: 2048×1536 px (QXGA) Super AMOLED display (RGB S Stripe[2]),<br>
			DPI: (264 ppi),<br>
			Size: 9.7 in (25 cm) diagonal<br>
			Mass    389 g (0.858 lb)<br>

			Laptop<br>
			HP Pavilion<br>
			CPU Family: AMD A10<br>
			HDD Capacity:1TB<br>
			Screen Size:14 inches<br>
			Memory Size:8GB Memory<br>
			Screen Resolution:1366x768<br>
			Keyboard:Full-size membrane island-style keyboard.<br><br>

			<h2>Typing Script</h2><br>

			The typing script will be printed in Arial font size 13 in black on A4 paper.<br><br>

			The script will be:<br>
			“The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner.”<br>
			Marking method<br><br>

			Errors will be marked by hand by the experimenters. Errors will be classified as errors of omission and commission respectively and counted by number of characters different from original script.

			The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The job requires extra pluck and zeal from every young wage earner.<br><br>

			<h2>Research Hypothesis:</h2><br>

			Using a virtual keyboard keyboard will result in an change in typing speed in AUT students compared with a physical laptop keyboard.<br>
			Null Hypothesis:<br><br>

			Using a virtual keyboard keyboard will result in an no change in typing speed or typing precision in AUT students as opposed to a physical laptop keyboard.<br><br>


			<h2>Measurement gathering</h2><br>

			Speed<br><br>

			Speed will be measured in the amount of time taken to complete the given paragraph.<br><br>

			Time<br><br>

			Time will be measured by the stopwatch function of the Motorola 5S+ mobile phone.<br><br>

			Accuracy<br><br>

			Accuracy will be measured by the number of errors of omission or commission. Each character different will be counted as a single error.<br><br>

			<h2>Execution</h2><br>
			Use convenience sampling to find participants that fit the criteria.<br>
			Ask participant to read information sheet.<br>
			Ask participant to sign consent form.<br>
			Ask participant to sit in front of the test device and make themselves comfortable.<br>
			Explain to the participant that they will have ten seconds to read the test script.
			They will then be directed to begin typing and to complete the paragraph as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy.<br>
			Inform them that they will still have access to the test script while typing<br>
			Let the participant know they will be able to read the test script while writing so they need not memorize it.<br>
			Hand the participant either the laptop or tablet.<br>
			Let the participant start once they have a clear understanding of the instructions.<br>
			Once the test is complete, thank the participant and let them know they are free to leave.<br><br>
